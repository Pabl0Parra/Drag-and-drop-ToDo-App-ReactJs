# Drag-and-drop ToDo app made with ReactJs & Vite

Site is live @https://tododragdrop.vercel.app/

This is a drag&drop Todo app that has dark/light theme capabilities. I have used:
- [zustand](https://docs.pmnd.rs/zustand/recipes/recipes) to manage the store,
- [uuid](https://github.com/uuidjs/uuid) to avoid id creation conflicts,
- [sass](https://sass-lang.com/) for styles, 
- [clsx](https://github.com/lukeed/clsx#readme) to set up conditions for setting the value of the className attribute,
- [react-beautiful-dnd](https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd#readme) to achieve the drag and drop capabilities.

## Getting started

1. $ npm create vite@latest
2. $ choose React with JavaScript
3. $ cd projectFolderName
4. $ npm install
5. $ npm run dev
